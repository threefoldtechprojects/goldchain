 # Gold Acquisition

## Using Fiat

 Questions:

 - How do we get a price?
 - How long is an offer valid?

 The price isdetermined at offer agreement.

 The offer needs to be registered somewhere.

 I suggest the user does not have to go through KYC and address authorization before accepting and making the payment in order to keep the onboarding process low entry. The user can do so later to really have the Gold tokens in it's wallet.

 ## Regular money transfer
Too slow, we are also not sure we will get the money

## External payment provider
This would allow us to easily accept fiat from credit cards in a first phase and guarantee us of getting the money.
